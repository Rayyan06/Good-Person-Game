## The Camo-Caravi Island Expedition
One day, Ibrahim went on an expedition to a rumored area called Camo Caravi Island. It was thought to be one of the most powerful countries in Good Person world ever. The leader was rumored to be known as “Camo Caravi”, an extremely powerful and mysterious person who never spoke or revealed a face yet. On the coast of the Island was Camo-Caravi City, an extremely powerful city which had a huge naval yard/harbor and a grand fleet of insane OP battleships. The mission initially didn’t go well and Ibrahim was pushed back hard, but eventually they managed to land on the Island and enter the Camo Caravi City.
The Alien Mission
Ibrahim and Mock went on a mission together because there were rumors of alien ships (UFOs) so they decided to discover the real story behind these UFOs. Ibrahim and Mock decided to fly in one plane that was speed and reliable. They started flying and actually encountered quite a few UFO’s but they sped past him at unthinkable speeds. After a while Ibrahim and Mock decided to go in different planes and in different directions, Rumaisa also later joined using a slightly bigger plane than the DHC 6 Twin Otter. Ibrahim saw the first UFO and called Mock and Rumaisa to help. Ibrahim tried to follow the UFO but it was too fast, also Ibrahim went the wrong direction and found a black spiral and decided that it might be alien land. He told Mock and Rumaisa the coordinates and went through. Alien land

*GOOD JOB.*

## The Rise of Son
Once upon a time, before the Siren Head Event, Kid was being really annoying. Ibrahim found out that Kid had a son whose name was son. Son was very smart and started doing science experiments without any tools or chemicals. After a lot of trial and error, he managed to create a moving ball which he could ride around in without any use of special chemicals. Soon, Ibrahim [Finish Later]
The Siren Head Kid Event
The Siren Head Event was a mission where Ibrahim, Venga Police, and Power’s Elite team fought a war against Kid, Coronavi, and Calco, who had created a giant robotic machine which they called “The Siren Head”. The Siren Head was very powerful and could blow up and destroy Good Person bunkers. The first thing that happened was that Ibrahim heard rumors that there was something mysterious going on inside a desert near PowerCity. Ibrahim went on an expedition into the desert in a Jeep Caravan. He wanted some water and found a well in the distance. Ibrahim went to the well and went inside it. After swimming through some tunnels, he found an underground good-person shop within the well! The small Good Person shop was selling souvenirs and supplies. The shop owner was very nice and told Ibrahim to never go out into the desert at night. He said that at night, something called the “Siren Head” comes out and it is very dangerous. He also said that a lot of people find the store by accident or by just being curious and entering the well. He said he makes a lot of $$$. 

	That night, Ibrahim decided to sneak out and investigate the so-called Siren Head.         Ibrahim wanted to see whether it was real of some fake stuff. Ibrahim heard the clear siren sound and realized that the Siren head was coming towards him.

## The 3 missions against Power
One day, there was a challenge between Ibrahim Khan and Power. The winner of the challenge would be the ruler of Good Person land for two weeks ( which was until we went to pakistan). So if Ibrahim won, he would lead the Good Person land. But if power won, he would continue to be the ruler. The challenge was broken up into three parts. Ibrahim khan and power both had to be in disguise and sometimes will meet while the challenge. 
It wasn’t entirely fair because power knew details about the missions, as you will see in each Mission.
# The Enemy Territory 
  In the first mission, Ibrahim had to make a Venga in enemy territory. So what Ibrahim did was 
# The Warehouse Battle
  The second of the missions was that Ibrahim had to sneak into the control center of a warehouse. However, it wasn’t going to be easy because the warehouse was loaded with security devices and sirens. In addition to this, Power was going to be raiding this exact warehouse also. 
# The Space Battle
  Ibrahim had to get onto a rocket and fake as an astronaut and manage to launch the rocket with him inside. [Taco Technique etc.]
## The Etherite mission
  One day, Ibrahim went out in search of an Island to build a new base and country. The reason he went out in search of a new base was that Power was being really annoying and he kept on making dumb rules. He found an Island that was pretty close to Camo Caravi’s island but it was still a really remote area. On the coast, there was a village with villagers who spoke English and a weird villager language. Ibrahim made friends with these locals and teamed up with them. They taught ibrahim how to speak their language.

  When mining they found this new ore, it was glowing green. They named it etherite because they found a rock which had “etherite” carved on it. As Ibrahim continued exploring the Island, he found a place where there was a volcano. He continued, and built a base in between some mountains. When he went mining, the miners found a weird mineral known as Etherite. They soon found out that Etherite had odd powers and strange abilities and Ibrahim decided to build a research lab and call Son to investigate. Ibrahim did not want Power finding out because he would probably do dumb stuff with it and claim all etherite for himself. As they did research on the Etherite, they found that when you vibrate two etherite crystals in the same way, you can teleport! However, there was one problem, and that was that when you used the crystals to teleport they disappeared. So they continued to do research, and found that there is a creature called the Ether which lives deep underground and produces Etherite. They went on to breed the Ethers until they multiplied and had a huge supply of Etherite. One more thing they found is that when rubb etheriter on your finger (thumb) you coat Etherite with a gel, you get an Ether Pearl. Ether pearls work a lot like Ender Pearls[Todo]

  Ibrahim then went back to Good Person land to check what was going on. He found that there was a really sus Venga store which had some weird stuff going on underneath the venga. Ibrahim,  venga police, and son went to investigate. They found that there was a machine underneath which was producing Etherite! They investigated and found that the Venga store was selling a lot of something called “Super Powder”. They tested the “Super Powder” and found traces of Etherite inside it….

## The Revving Mission (With Bob, Tim, and Jim)
  The Revving Mission started when Ibrahim was going around Power City and saw something sus going on. He saw someone going into a Venga and buying a lot of supplies for some sort of mission. Ibrahim went inside the bed of that person’s pickup truck and started spying on him, following him everywhere. He saw this person buying a lot of stuff and found out that his name was Jim. Jim then continued and went to a Venga Guns and Ammo and bought a lot of guns. Ibrahim continued to hide in Jim’s pickup truck and watch what was going on. Jim went to a camping area and

  Then they saw Jim go to another person's house. That other person’s name was Tim, and he was lawn mowing his yard. Then, they saw another person, Bob, come there also. Ibrahim was spying on them and heard them planning something together. They were planning to create their own country and use their powers to fight Good Person land. Ibrahim learnt that Bob was very good at shooting guns, and could do something with a gun called revving it. He learnt that Tim could create walls very rapidly and was an expert in construction. He also learnt that Jim was an expert Chemist and could create a weird fungus gel which helped in revving. { THE WAR } { THE SPEEDRUN COMPETITION, ETC }









## The slime mission

  One day, Ibrahim was going undercover in a Venga, checking that stuff was going normally and that nothing crazy was happening. Then, something crazy happened. Someone managed to get Ibrahim in jail. Ibrahim got in jail because he was trying to film the slimes with a farmer and managed to get a photo. But then a venga police came and said “I am Ibrahim” but he looked like a normal venga police except his skin was slightly green. He then morphed into Ibrahim shape and size and had all of his documents in his pockets. He arrested Ibrahim and put him in jail and then protested as Ibrahim. They had a fabricated ID, a fake outfit, fake everything! People believed that he was indeed the CEO of Venga, when in reality he obviously was not. TODO: finish and add the slime one v one the fake CEO and ibrahim did 
 The kids spawner mission

## The kids city 
  The kid city started when Ibrahim made a law to cause murders to happen less. It was about people unable to go outside after 12:00 am at night. 

## Braun Mission 
  Forgotten



## The Sniper Mission
  The entire kids city started when Ibrahim was walking on the street and he heard gunshots. Someone came up to ibrahim and said there were snipers in some apartment buildings. Then they heard more and more and then Ibrahim and some good person police decided to go up and try to look for the snipers and arrest them.
