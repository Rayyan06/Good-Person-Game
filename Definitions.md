### Killer B story
Killer B was a normal person one day, but he had special abilities like he was very smart and could think of plans very well. He quickly became one of the most powerful people in Power City.
### Predator X
 Predator x was invented when we watched a documentary about Predator X. We also realized that it was a very good hunter and swimmer because it could easily kill a plesiosaur. He has also never did a face reveal yet in our game. He was not that popular in the game and we soon never talked about him again. However, he is still mentioned occasionally.
### Power
Once upon a time, Power was just a low ranking poop-cleaner. He wanted to become the ruler of the Good Person country onFe day. So he grinded and Ibrahim noticed that he was ranking up his levels and decided to help, slowly getting his rank up, until he was noticed by Waca and Kane. Waca and Kane realized that he should be leader because of his name and then Power’s career started.

### Venga Rise
One day, Ibrahim wanted to start a store because He had seen a lot of others competing against each other. What Ibrahim did was open up a supermarket and have really cheap prices. He got funds from power and missions. Many people came to the grand opening of the Venga store and was such a big hit that everything sold out almost immediately. He expanded and made more stores until they became known as The {second, zoof is better} Best Shopping Store Out There, a trillion dollar company, and an awesome CEO.
